ABOUT
------ 
This project is a console application which is an added feature that I added even though it was not asked for. The current environment that I have been working since the past 2.5 years 
uses on Manual Testing. Since I do not have a very strong hold on writing test cases or using any form of testing methodologies, I converted the application into a console application 
for the purpose of manual testing. Although I do agree that using test cases would definitely be a faster way to find and address issues during development. Given the 
right opportunity I would love to educate myself and became part of a 'Test Driven Development' environment.

Thank you,
